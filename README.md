This project was about creating a landing page using the knowledge learnt during the previous lessons, including flexbox, html tags etc. I was given a picture as a template to follow but I took the freedom to go ahead and modify some of the guidelines, including some css that I learnt myself (fixed background just to mention one). During the project I had to Google search a couple of properties.
